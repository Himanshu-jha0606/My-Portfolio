  <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
<p>My name is <b>Himanshu Jha</b>, and I'm a 21-year-old aspiring <b>full-stack web developer</b>
  with a deep passion for both technology and creativity.Currently, I'm preparing
  to become a skilled web developer, focusing on mastering both front-end and back-end
  technologies.My goal is to not only excel in web development but also pursue a career
  as an <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) developer</b>, blending technical skills with strategic thinking to create
  impactful digital products.</p>

<p>While technology is a big part of my life, I also have a strong passion for <b>music</b>.
  Singing and playing the guitar are activities I love, as they allow me to express
  myself creatively and unwind from the fast-paced world of coding. Music has always
  been an essential part of who I am, and it provides a balance to my technical pursuits.
</p>
<p>In my journey, I’m committed to continuously <b>learning and evolving</b> in the tech space.
  I believe that both web development and product management require a blend
  of problem-solving, communication, and creativity, which are qualities I’m always
  striving to develop. I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and
  building innovative solutions that can make a difference.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I see myself working at the intersection of technology and user-centered design, building products that not only function well but also bring value to people’s lives. Whether coding or strumming my guitar, I’m always looking for ways to grow and improve.</p>
